Foresight is a chrome extension built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
It allows users to hover over links and see a preview of the webpage without actually clicking on the link.

The idea was forumlated and programmed at AthenaHacks in April 2017.
It is intended to be used while searching to increase efficiency of research or simple browsing.
